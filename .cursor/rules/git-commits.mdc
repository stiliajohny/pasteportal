# Git Commit Rules

When making commits, always follow these rules:

## 1. Conventional Commit Format

**ALWAYS use Conventional Commits specification:**

- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- Types allowed: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `revert`
- Scope is optional but recommended for clarity
- Subject should be lowercase and imperative mood

**Examples:**

```
feat(auth): add user login functionality
fix(api): resolve paste encryption issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(components): simplify header navigation
chore(deps): update dependencies
```

## 2. Commit Message Structure

**Keep commit messages simple and short:**

- Subject line: Maximum 72 characters
- Body (if needed): Simple, concise explanation (optional)
- No detailed explanations unless absolutely necessary
- Focus on WHAT changed, not WHY (unless context is critical)

**Good examples:**

```
feat(paste): add password protection
fix(ui): correct mobile menu z-index
refactor(db): consolidate migration files
```

**Avoid:**

```
feat: implement a comprehensive password protection feature that allows users to secure their pastes with passwords using bcrypt hashing and secure storage
```

## 3. Commit After Every Feature

**Commit immediately after completing each user-requested feature:**

- After implementing a feature: commit with `feat` type
- After fixing a bug: commit with `fix` type
- After refactoring: commit with `refactor` type
- After updating documentation: commit with `docs` type
- After other changes: use appropriate type

**When to commit:**

- ✅ Immediately after the feature is complete and tested
- ✅ Before moving on to the next feature
- ✅ After fixing bugs found during implementation
- ✅ After making related refactoring improvements

**When NOT to commit:**

- ❌ Multiple unrelated changes in one commit
- ❌ WIP (Work In Progress) commits unless explicitly requested
- ❌ Commits with broken code that doesn't build or run

## 4. Commit Message Best Practices

**DO:**

- ✅ Use imperative mood: "add", "fix", "update", not "added", "fixed", "updated"
- ✅ Keep scope specific to the area changed (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`, `db`)
- ✅ Use present tense: "add feature" not "added feature"
- ✅ Start with lowercase (except for proper nouns)
- ✅ Be specific but concise

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Use past tense or past participle
- ❌ Include detailed explanations in the subject line
- ❌ Exceed 72 characters in the subject line
- ❌ Use generic scopes like `misc`, `stuff`, `updates`
- ❌ Include multiple features in one commit

## 5. Commit Body Guidelines

**If a body is needed, keep it simple:**

- Maximum 2-3 lines
- Explain the "what" briefly
- Only include "why" if it's non-obvious
- Use bullet points for multiple changes

**Example:**

```
feat(api): add paste encryption endpoint

- Encrypt paste content before storage
- Use environment variable for encryption key
```

## 6. Commit Automation

**Always commit using terminal commands:**

- Use: `git commit -m "type(scope): subject"`
- For commits with body: `git commit -m "type(scope): subject" -m "body line"`
- Stage files before committing: `git add <files>`
- Commit all changes when appropriate: `git add -A` or `git add .`

**Commit workflow:**

1. Complete the feature/bug fix
2. Stage relevant files
3. Create commit with conventional commit format
4. Continue with next task

## 7. Scope Guidelines

**Common scopes to use:**

- `auth`: Authentication and authorization
- `api`: API routes and endpoints
- `ui`: User interface components
- `db`: Database migrations and schema
- `config`: Configuration files
- `deps`: Dependencies
- `docs`: Documentation
- `styles`: CSS and styling
- `utils`: Utility functions
- `types`: TypeScript types
- `tests`: Test files

**Example commits:**

```
feat(auth): add OAuth login
fix(api): handle encryption errors gracefully
refactor(ui): simplify component structure
docs(readme): add deployment instructions
chore(deps): update Next.js to latest version
```
